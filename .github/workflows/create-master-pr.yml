# The logic of `create-pull-request` seems a bit counterintuitive, as we "just want to merge stage into master".
# However, the action expects you to checkout the base branch and "make some changes".
# In our case, "making changes" will be fetching `stage` and resetting the local branch to it, so `create-pull-request` can pick up the changes.
