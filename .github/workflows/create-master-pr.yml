# peter-evans/create-pull-request expects the base to be the branch checked out by the checkout action.
# actions/checkout by default checks out the branch being pushed, but in this case the base.
# So if we check out master and then reset it to stage to pull in the latest changes, to be then picked up by create-pull-request.
